<p>&#8220;Apologies take them months, years, decades. For me, apologies take only milliseconds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I intend to get the following line of sans-serif text tattooed onto my left shoulder: KARLINA OBJECT DOT WORDPRESS DOT COM.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p><span style="background: #ffff00">I believe it is useful for me to believe in some delusions temporarily as a means for me to eventually attain a more truthful understanding (while aspiring to always attain an increasingly comprehensive and accurate understanding as time elapses forward in that understanding&#8217;s lifespan).</span></p>
<p>I believe that it is useful for me (and perhaps other persons (but probably not all persons simultaneously)) to believe that whatever a person experiences is exactly what that person most desires 100% of the time.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;You are experiencing the virtual reality you ordered.&#8221;</em></p>
