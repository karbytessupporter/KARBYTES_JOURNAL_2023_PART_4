<p>This morning I was browsing the Internet for information on the prices of electric cars. Unfortunately, even the electric cars which were labeled as most affordable still seem to be out of my expected affordability range. In order to afford a $40,000 electric car, I would not even be able to save more than $1,000 per month for that purpose (which means that it would likely take me at least 3 years of being extremely frugal to buy a car which I cannot afford to replace nor repair). My plan is to continue borrowing my mom&#8217;s gasoline powered Toyota Matrix and driving it while I do not have a bicycle and while the weather is bad. I understand that taking a bicycle to work while everyone else drives there is a thankless job and not as convenient and socially condoned as is driving a car (and I expect more than 95% of my coworkers to be driving gasoline powered cars). I also think I may be the only vegan in that workplace. Oh well. This morning I was browsing the Internet for information on the prices of electric cars.

I also think I may be the only vegan in that workplace. Oh well. <span style="background:#ffff00">Human life expectancy is still abysmally short even though I believe that dying of old age is physically preventable such that a human could feasibly live for at least 700 years. I have (educated) faith that humanity will be able to prevent Earth&#8217;s ecosystems and environments from becoming inhospitable to the long-term survival of the human species (and that fossil fuels will be completely replaced by more renewable forms of energy if not nuclear fusion within my lifetime). Then again, there is always a probability greater than 0% that humanity will go extinct due to environmental collapse as a consequence of human activity.</span> Rather than make my sense of purpose in life dependent upon saving the environment and being a good role model for how to be environmentally conscientious (while most other humans cancel out my &#8220;good&#8221; conduct with their &#8220;bad&#8221; conduct), I will &#8220;settle&#8221; for being, more or less, approximately as hedonistic and selfish as my human peers are. I honestly think few humans have much to be proud of themselves for. All I can say about most humans is that they seem to implicitly demand praise and sympathy for doing the bare minimum to help themselves and their families survive and be modestly comfortable while they do while barely accomplishing that feat (and often while complaining profusely and being wasteful and reckless and lazy). I am an expert at dealing with the human condition. Otherwise, I would have settled for having kids and/or getting married. Most humans are too shallow, sheltered, ignorant, boring, egotistical, and mentally weak for me to stand the company of (yet I do my best to pretend I enjoy the company of whoever I happen to be in vicinity to). Hence, I prefer to spend my free time alone rather than hanging out with other humans.</p>

<p>I apologize for my harsh and unappreciative and perhaps misinformed comments. I am ashamed of myself for being so lazy, slow, dumb, stingy, and unkind but at the same time my logical reasoning suggests that every person is only able to think, perceive, and behave in exactly one way as a function of the entire universe at a given point in time. I suppose therefore it is fair and helpful to be as forgiving and accepting of reality as possible (and as truthful in my understanding of reality as possible). Thank you for forgiving for my inadequacies and thank you for attempting to understand and tolerate my existence and how I apparently choose to behave.</p>
